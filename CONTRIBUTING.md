# Contributing to Eclipse GMF Runtime

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse GMF Runtime is an industry proven application framework for creating
graphical editors using Eclipse EMF and Eclipse GEF. The GMF Runtime provides
many features that one would have to code by hand if using EMF and GMF directly.
A set of reusable components for graphical editors, such as printing, image
export, actions and toolbars and much more. A standardized model to describe
diagram elements, which separates between the semantic (domain) and notation
(diagram) elements. A command infrastructure that bridges the different command
frameworks used by EMF and GEF. An extensible framework that allows graphical
editors to be open and extendible.
