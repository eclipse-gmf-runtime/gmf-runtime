Provides a set of classes that extend from the org.eclipse.draw2d 
hierarchies for rendering, geometric manipulation and layout of figures
on the drawing surface.

<p>These classes can be used when constructing your figures for display.  These figures
will typically have a GEF dependency which is why they cannot be placed in the pure draw2D.ui
plug-in.  The dependency is usually caused by the <code>org.eclipse.gef.handles.HandleBounds</code>
interface which needs to be installed on top level figures in order to accurately calculate
the bounding box that the handle feedback needs to attach to. </p>
